* CoffeeScript + Stylus + Handlebars as app languages
* Backbone as main framework
* Cross-module communication using the Mediator and Publish/Subscribe patterns
* Controllers for managing individual UI views
* Rails-style routes which map URLs to controller actions
* An application view as dispatcher and view manager
* Extended model, view and collection classes to avoid repetition and
enforce conventions
* Strict memory management and object disposal
* A collection with additional manipulation methods for smarter change events
* A collection view for easy and intelligent list rendering
* Client-side authentication using service providers like Facebook, Google
and Twitter
* Easy debugging: just uncomment `#console.debug` in all files.

## Getting started

* First install brunch `npm install -g brunch`
* Clone or download this project.
* Create new project via executing `brunch new <appName> -t ~/brunch-with-chaplin/`

Edit `app/lib/services/facebook.coffee` and change `facebookAppId` to your ID. 
Note that if you'll use predefined `facebookAppId`, you'll need to use
